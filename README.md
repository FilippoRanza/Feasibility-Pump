Feasibility Pump - find feasible solution for a Binary Integer Programming
problem. 

## Rationale

The Feasibility Pump is heuristic usefull to find a feasible solution 
to Mixed Integer Programming problem.

This implementation is specifically designed to work with Binary Programming problems, defined as:

    \text{subject to}\\
    &Ax \geq b\\
    &x_i \in \{0, 1\}
\end{align*}" title="01MIP" />
