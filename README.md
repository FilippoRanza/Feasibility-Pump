Feasibility Pump - find feasible solution for a Binary Programming
problem. 

## Rationale

The Feasibility Pump(FP) is a heuristic usefull to find a feasible solution 
to Mixed Integer Programming problem. This implementation is specifically designed to work with Binary Programming problems. FP is not defigned to 
find optimal solution nor a good one, it's only purpose is to find
a  feasible solution in a small amount of time, even for those problem 
where a greedy algorithm cannot produce feasible result.
